work on DockerHttpWrapperTest
= problem is that docker-py returns different stuff than raw docker rest api!

use coverage + other static analsys tools to rm as much as possible - especially in Models
= +incoproate more pre-condition tests

look at structure of swaggar.yaml - for clues as to how to call

work on JunitDockerHttpExtensionTest to actually use the extension

incoporate maven processes - i.e. jaccomo + sonarcube

check volumes created correctly in pytest-docker-py
